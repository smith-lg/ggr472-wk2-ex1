# GGR472 Week 2: Exercise i
## Building a basic webpage and working with Bootstrap
This repository contains code for an example webpage created during Exercise i.

Students, you are welcome to explore the code and clone the repository.

Example webpage: https://smith-lg.github.io/ggr472-wk2-ex1/
Leaves a lot to work on but hopefully provides an idea of how to build a web page and incorporate the Bootstrap library!
